# 🧬 Diabetes Risk Analysis using R (MASS Package)

## 📌 Project Overview
This project investigates biological and clinical
risk factors associated with Type-2 Diabetes
using the Pima Indians dataset from the MASS package in R.

## 🧪 Biological Background
Type-2 Diabetes is a metabolic disorder influenced by
plasma glucose levels, body mass index (BMI),
age, and blood pressure. Understanding these
factors is crucial for epidemiology and public health research.

## 📊 Dataset
- Source: MASS package (Pima.tr, Pima.te)
- Population: Adult female Pima Indians
- Response Variable: Diabetes status (Yes/No)

## 🎯 Objectives
- Identify significant biological risk factors
- Apply logistic regression
- Interpret results in life-science context
- Validate the predictive model

## 🧰 Tools & Skills
- R Programming
- Biostatistics
- Logistic Regression
- Data Visualization
- Biomedical Data Interpretation

## 🔬 Methods
1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
2. Visualization of clinical variables
3. Logistic regression modeling
4. Model validation on test data

## 📈 Key Findings
- Plasma glucose is the strongest predictor of diabetes
- BMI significantly increases disease risk
- Age shows moderate association
- Results align with known metabolic disease mechanisms
